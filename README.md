# Overview

This README contains all information on how to run ***BADDIE*** *: Brainpart Anatomical Decomposition with DKTatlas-guided Image Extraction*, a preprocessing pipeline originally put together for *Multimodal Deep Learning with MRI-Clinical Integration for Prediction of Prognosis in Central Nervous System Infections*.

![](/images/pipeline_diagram_v2.png)

Above is a diagram for the BADDIE Pipeline. The BADDIE pipeline consists of three main parts for **Resampling**, **Segmentation** and **Brainpart Extraction**. The **Resampling** Part relies entirely on the resampling method used in **lab2im**, and the **Segmentation** Part on FastSurferCNN from **FastSurfer**. Both libraries are linked and cited in the bottom of this README. The **Brainpart Extraction** part relies on our original library **Seg2Seg**(Segmentation to Segments).

The segmentations utilize the [Desikan-Killiany-Tourville(DKT) atlas](https://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/fswiki/CorticalParcellation), akin to the segmentation methodology employed in Freesurfer. Below is an image displaying the contours of the DKT atlas. The visualization was created using [Nilearn](https://nilearn.github.io/stable/index.html).

The input MRI data must be T1-Weighted MRI images in NIFTI(Neuroimaging Informatics Technology Initiative) format, either as .nii or .nii.gz files, or in a compatible format.

# Getting Started

## Installation
To install BADDIE, clone this repository to your desired location using below code :

```bash
git clone https://github.com/choiyh592/BADDIE.git
cd BADDIE
```

### Requirements
BADDIE was developed using Python 3.10.4. Thus a Python version of 3.10.4 is recommended.

You can install all requirements by executing the following code.
* For Windows or Linux : 
```bash
 python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

* For Mac : 
```bash
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.mac.txt
```

## Usage
The Syntax for running the entire pipeline is :
```
python3 BADDIE/main.py \
    --inputtxt /path/to/your/input/filepaths/text/file \
    --sidtxt /path/to/your/patient/ids/text/file \
    --outputdir /path/to/your/output/directory \
    --device your_device \
    --va False
```
To execute the entire pipeline, you can run the above code in the terminal after navigating to the root directory of your local repository.

The execution takes about 6 minutes per MRI, assuming that FastSurferCNN is run on GPU. Using a GPU is highly recommended.

### Flags
BADDIE utilizes the ```argparse``` module from python to interpret the flags(arguments). You can view the descriptions by running : 
```
python BADDIE/main.py --help
```
Below are descriptions for the flags.
* `--inputtxt`(str): Text File containing T1 MRI paths for all subjects. There should be only one path per line. An example is provided below.
* `--outputdir`(str): Path for a single directory to contain all outputs. An example is provided below.
* `--sidtxt`(str): Text File containing the subject ID to use. There should be only one ID per line. \
Should be in the same order as the --inputtxt file. Should have the same number of lines as the `--inputtxt` file. Should be unique. \
An example is provided below.
* `--device`(str): Select device to run FastSurferCNN inference on: cpu, or cuda(= Nvidia GPU) or specify a certain GPU (e.g. cuda:1). ```auto``` by default.
* `--va`(bool) : If true, volumetric analyses on all segmented files are performed. False by default.

### Input Requirements & Recommendations
BADDIE Takes 4 Arguments: `--inputtxt`, `--sidtxt`, `--outputdir`, `--device`.

`--inputtxt` : String containing the **Absolute Path** to Text file containing the **Absolute Paths** of the input T1 MRI Data. Below is an example.
```
--inputtxt /home/yhchoi/textfiles/niftipaths.txt
```
Below is an example illustrating the content format of the file.
```
/home/yhchoi/NIFTI/T1/01.nii.gz
/home/yhchoi/NIFTI/T1/02.nii.gz
```
Note that order matters : The order of data in the final results will depend on the order of the filepaths in `--inputtxt`.

`--sidtxt` : String containing the **Absolute Path** to Text file containing the **Unique** IDs for the resampled T1 MRI Data. Below is an example.
```
--sidtxt /home/yhchoi/textfiles/patientIDs.txt
```
Below is an example illustrating the content format of the file.
```
1_11112222
2_22223333
```
In this format, each line consists of an index followed by an underscore and an ID.
This indexing method ensures uniqueness and aids in maintaining the order of file paths. \
Note that the order of the filepaths should be the same as in `--inputtxt`. \
We recommend that you index the IDs like above (indexed and separated with an underscore) to assure uniqueness.

`--outputdir` : String containing the **Absolute Path** where you wish to contain the outputs. Below is an example.
```
/home/yhchoi/project/preprocessing_data
```

`--device` : String containing the name of the device to perform FastSurferCNN Inference on. We highly recommend using a GPU('cuda').

`--va` : This option decides whether to conduct volumetric analysis. Can be `True` or `False`. If `True`, the outcomes will be saved as `__volumetic_analysis.csv` in the `/test_files` directory within the output folder. Patient volumes are recorded in cubic millimeters (mm<sup>3</sup>). If `False`(Default), volumetic analysis is skipped. Volumetric analysis takes about 30 seconds per image.

### Outputs
The `--outputdir` flag determines the (absolute) location of the outputs.

4 subdirectories will be created within the output directory : `resampled`, `segmentations`, `extractions`, `text_files`.
* `resampled` : Subdirectory containing the resampled MRI files.
* `segmentations` : Subdirectory containing the segment masks and conformed MRI files. 
Segmentation of each patient is stored in subdirectories with the patient ID as the name. \
Below is the FastSurfer documentation for the segmentation outputs.

    | directory   | filename                      | module    | description |
    |:------------|-------------------------------|-----------|-------------|
    | mri         | aparc.DKTatlas+aseg.deep.mgz  | asegdkt   | cortical and subcortical segmentation|
    | mri         | aseg.auto_noCCseg.mgz         | asegdkt   | simplified subcortical segmentation without corpus callosum labels|
    | mri         | mask.mgz                      | asegdkt   | brainmask|
    | mri         | orig.mgz                      | asegdkt   | conformed image|
    | mri/orig    | 001.mgz                       | asegdkt   | original image|
    | .           | qc_log.log                    | asegdkt   | quality check logfile : will be empty if the qc process is successful|
    | .           | seg_log.log                   | asegdkt   | segmentation logs|

* `extractions` : Subdirectory containing the extracted, cropped and padded MRI files and a tensor dataset containing the files. \
The order of files in the tensor dataset corresponds to the sequential order specified in the `--inputtxt` file.
Below is the documentation for the extraction outputs.

    | directory   | description                   |
    |:------------|-------------------------------|
    | {BRAINPART}_EXTRACT | Directory containing extracted MRI files of specific brainpart {BRAINPART}|
    | {BRAINPART}_CROPPED | Directory containing extracted MRI files of {BRAINPART} cropped to minimal size|
    | {BRAINPART}_PADDED  | Directory containing cropped MRI files of {BRAINPART} padded to match sizes|
    | {BRAINPART}_TENSORS | Directory containing tensor dataset containing the padded MRI files of {BRAINPART}|

    Brain parts categorized as left and right were placed into separate subdirectories named /left and /right.
    The tensors representing the left and right images were concatenated into a single tensor dataset, with the left image tensors preceding the right image tensors.

* `text_files` : Subdirectory containing text files with straightforward names, which contains paths to created files.
The order of paths in the text file corresponds to the sequential order specified in the `--inputtxt` file.\
CSV files containing the outcomes of quality checks and volumetric analyses are also provided in this directory.\
The `__qc_failed.csv` file contains paths to files that failed the quality check. The files in the csv should have faulty segmentations. \
The `__volumetric_analysis.csv` file is created if `--va` is set to `True`. It contains volumetric assessments for each patient, identified by their unique patient IDs provided in `--sid`.

Below is an example output demonstrating the utilization of the flags provided above.

## Removal of images that failed the Quality Check from the tensor datasets
You can run the below code to remove the filepaths of images that failed the Quality Check from the filepath text files,
and Remove the faulty images from the tensor datasets.
```
python3 BADDIE/remove_qc_failed.py \
    --outputdir /path/to/your/output/directory
```
`--outputdir` should be the unmodified output directory of our `main.py` execution. Manipulation of the directory structure could lead to faluty results.

To run this code, indexing your `--sidtxt` in the format of the recommendation above(indexed and separated with an underscore: e.g. 1_11112222, 2_22223333, {index_number}_{patient_id}...) is mandatory. If you wish to index your sids differently, you can modify the `retrieve_patient_idx()` function in `BADDIE/Seg2Seg/segment_qc.py`.

Running this code modifies the following :
* outputdir/text_files/__volumetric_analysis.csv
* outputdir/text_files/nifti_{BRAINPART}_padded_paths.txt
* outputdir/extractions/{BRAINPART}_TENSORS/{BRAINPART}_dataset.pt

for all Brainparts.

Note that this code eliminates every occurrence of patients with failed QC files from the tensor datasets across all brain regions, ensuring uniformity. For example, if `/Outputs/extractions/PUTAMEN_CROPPED/left/183_10678967.nii.gz` is in your `__qc_failed.csv`, All brain part segments from patient `183` is deleted from all tensor datasets.
